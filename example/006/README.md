FA-Injector Example 006

This example loads a phone bundle and a phone sized image; or it loads a desktop
bundle and a desktop image.  Many websites pull down the phone and the desktop
assets - then it hides the assets appropriately.  In this example in phone mode
the desktop assets are never loaded and vice versa.

FA-Injector Example 008

This example doesn't load any tab bundles until a tab is clicked.  The bundles
contain the HTML, CSS, and JS for the specific tab.  The bundle is only loaded
when the tab is click.  So in this example a user might log into update their
user data.  The user can click on the user tab.  The the user HTML, JS, and CSS
are loaded.  The Account and Location assets are never loaded.
